My name is Buck and I came here to party... Or just build simple useful websites for the internet. That usually equates to me standing at my desk pecking on my mechanical keyboard(s) for hours trying to figure out why things aren't working as expected for my clients, or attempting to make their sites the next greatest thing out there. I live in the terminal and love Vim and tmux. I tend to be a bit OCD when it comes to programming, moreso with workflows for development opposed to the actual code being written. Though I also like to write clean, functional code. If you think you might be able to utilize my skills feel free to reach out to me!
